- in single idea view, make the comments completely
  decoupled from the IdeaDetailsView. This means doing any
  checks and rendering on the CommentsView object and
  moving the #comments div to its own template

- bug where refreshing while currently on a page causes the
  path to reset to "/". Also, when the path has reset to "/",
  clicking on a link to load the index page does not work.

- sort the posts that get loaded.

- ability to delete posts

done:
- render previous comments
- have ability to save comments. 
- make sure server side that any put request to update a 
  model is being checked if user is allowed to update model.
- update model on front end after it has been edited
- make sure only users logged in can write comments. Maybe
  come up with a easy to use method for parts of the app
  that need users to be logged in
- make sure usernames are unique when registering
