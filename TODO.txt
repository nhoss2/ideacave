- in single idea view, make the comments completely
  decoupled from the IdeaDetailsView. This means doing any
  checks and rendering on the CommentsView object and
  moving the #comments div to its own template

- have ability to save comments. 

- make sure only users logged in can write comments. Maybe
  come up with a easy to use method for parts of the app
  that need users to be loged in

- render previous comments

- make sure server side that any put request to update a 
  model is being checked if user is allowed to update model.
